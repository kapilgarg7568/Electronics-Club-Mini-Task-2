# **Advanced Irrigation System**

**Problem Statement:**

To create an advanced automated irrigation system which can keep track the current atmospheric and weather conditions like moisture in soil and humidity present and accordingly turn on/off the water supply with updating the status of water pump and soil moisture by sending and recieving message.

**Ideation

- Understanding the mechanism: 

`Temp.,Humidity and Soil Moisture sensor`=>Input for `Microcontroller`(Analyse the input signal)`=>give command to `Relay`=>Water Pump` 
=>`Irrigation to plants.`

|dispaly the data recieved from differnt sensors|<=`Microcontroller`=>|Send Updates and Recieve messages|
